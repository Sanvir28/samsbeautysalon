This website shouldn’t be a store. It should just be a website displaying who they are what they do and what services they provide.
Users should be able to login/signup using firebase credentials and store all data they use on the site in a firestore database. Please tell me what and how to get the details you need to set this up. You should be able to login/signup with Google and Regular Email and Password. When you first create an account for the first time it should give you a coupon you can use on the site to give you a 5% off discount on a booking. There should be a built in admin account with credentials: user: admin pass: samsadmin (please make these credentials easy to change in the code in case i want to change them).
There should be appointment booking with a calendar looking system with timeslots and availability based. You should be able to cancel appointments. Up to 3 people can book and appointment at the same time online. The time booking should be separated by 30 minutes each. All of these appoints should be forms asking what their name is what their phone number is and what services they want. Please note you must let the users know that the website isnt a store and everything booked will be payed in person. If you are logged into the admin account the website layout should be a bit different. It should display all bookings in a spreadsheet calendar based system. The admin account should also be able to book appointments for people and can override the 3 people per time slot if needed.
Their store hours are: Friday 10 AM–7 PM
Saturday 10 AM–6 PM
